    <div class="header">How to Wear a Scarf</div>

    <p class="scarf-describe">A scarf worn with a professional outfit, like a suit, adds a layer of style, sophistication, and sometimes warmth. For formal wear, scarves are typically lightweight and made from fine materials like silk, cashmere, or high-quality wool, keeping the look polished. When draped around the neck, they can add a subtle color or pattern that complements the suit without overwhelming it.</p>

      <h3>Four ways to wear a Scarf</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Drape</strong>
          <p>This is the simplest and most traditional style, often seen with professional attire.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Drape the scarf evenly around your neck, letting each end fall in front.</li>
            <li>Adjust the length so the scarf rests just above the suitâ€™s buttons.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The Once-Around</strong>
          <p>This style offers a bit more coverage and is excellent for cooler settings.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Place the scarf around your neck, leaving one end slightly longer than the other.</li>
            <li>Take the longer end and wrap it around your neck once, letting both ends hang in front.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The French Knot</strong>
          <p>A stylish, polished option, perfect for a professional setting.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Fold the scarf in half lengthwise, creating a loop at one end.</li>
            <li>Place the folded scarf around your neck with the loop on one side.</li>
            <li>Pull the loose ends through the loop and adjust for comfort and tightness.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The Reverse Drape Cross</strong>
          <p>This is a more secure style that stays in place and offers extra warmth.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Drape the scarf around your neck with one end longer than the other.</li>
            <li>Wrap the longer end around your neck and bring it back to the front.</li>
            <li>Tuck both ends neatly, letting them fall at even lengths in front.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

      </ul>
