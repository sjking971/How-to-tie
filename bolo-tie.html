      <h3>How to Tie a Bolo Tie</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>Start by placing the bolo tie around your neck with the decorative clasp (or slide) hanging down at the center. The ends of the bolo tie should hang equally on both sides.</li>

      <li>Adjust the ends of the bolo tie so that they are of equal length. Typically, the ends should hang down to about the middle of your chest.</li>

      <li>Take the left end of the bolo tie and cross it over the right end, forming an X shape just below your chin.</li>

      <li>Take the left end (which is now on top) and bring it underneath the right end, then pull it up through the neck loop you created.</li>

      <li>Gently pull on both ends of the bolo tie to tighten the knot around your neck. Ensure that the decorative clasp is still positioned at the center.</li>

      <li>Slide the decorative clasp down towards the base of the knot until it sits comfortably against your collar. Ensure it is centered and adjusted to your preference.</li>

      <li>Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the bolo tie is hanging evenly and looks neat. The ends can be positioned to hang freely or adjusted to your desired length.</li>
      </ul>
