      <h3>How to Tie a Cravat Tie</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>Start by placing the cravat around your neck, with the wider end (the "tail") hanging down on your right side and the narrower end (the "blade") on your left side.</li>

        <li>Cross the wide end over the narrow end, forming an X shape just below your chin.</li>

        <li>Bring the wide end underneath the narrow end and then up through the neck loop. Pull it down gently to secure it.</li>

        <li>Fold the narrow end over to the right side, creating the first half of the bow shape.</li>

        <li>Take the wide end and wrap it around the center of the bow you just formed, going from right to left.</li>

        <li>Bring the wide end down through the loop that you created at the center of the bow.</li>

        <li>Gently pull both sides of the bow to tighten it. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the cravat looks symmetrical and sits comfortably against your neck.</li>

        <li>Tuck the ends of the cravat into your waistcoat or leave them to hang elegantly, depending on your desired look. Adjust the knot for comfort and style.</li>
      </ul>
