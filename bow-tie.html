    <div class="header">How to Tie a Bow Tie?</div>

    <p class="bow-tie-describe">One must regard it as a most exquisite accessory, steeped in tradition and sophistication. This delightful piece of neckwear is characterized by its charmingly knotted form, elegantly perched beneath the collar of a well-tailored shirt. A bow tie is fashioned from a length of fine fabric, which, when deftly tied, forms a graceful bow shape. The ends of this fabric create delightful loops, cinched at the center to achieve that quintessential silhouette.</p>

      <h3>How to Tie a Bow Tie</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>Drape the bow tie around your neck, with one end (the "wide end") hanging about 1.5 inches lower than the other end (the "narrow end"). The narrow end will be on your left side.</li>

        <li>Cross the wide end over the narrow end, forming an X shape just below your chin.</li>

        <li>Bring the wide end under the narrow end and pull it through the neck loop, but do not tighten it yet.</li>

        <li>Create the front of the bow tie by folding the narrow end back over to the right. This forms the first half of the bow.</li>

        <li>Take the wide end (which is now hanging down) and wrap it around the center of the bow you just formed. This gives the bow its characteristic shape.</li>

        <li>With the wide end wrapped around, bring it to the front and down through the loop you created in the center of the bow.</li>

        <li>Pull both sides of the bow gently to tighten it. Adjust the bow tie until it looks symmetrical and neat. You can also pull on the narrow end to adjust the fit around your neck.</li>

        <li>Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the bow tie is even and sits comfortably against your collar.</li>
      </ul>
