    <div class="header">How to Wear a Suit</div>

    <p class="suit-describe">A suit is a coordinated set of formal clothing typically worn for business, formal events, or professional settings. It generally consists of a jacket and trousers made from matching fabric, and sometimes includes a matching vest (three-piece suit). Suits are designed to create a polished, cohesive look that is both stylish and structured, providing a sleek, tailored appearance.</p>

      <h3>How to wear a Suit</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ensure a Proper Fit:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>The shoulders should fit snugly without overextending or creating a gap.</li>
            <li>Sleeves should end at the wrist bone, allowing about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of the shirt cuff to show.</li>
            <li>The jacket hem should cover the seat and reach around the middle of your hand when arms are at your sides.</li>
            <li>Pants should sit comfortably at the waist without needing a belt for support. The length should have a slight break (fold) above the shoe or be hemmed for a no-break, modern look.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Buttoning the Jacket:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Fasten only the top button when standing, and always unbutton it when sitting.</li>
            <li>Fasten only the middle button, or the top two if preferred. Always unbutton all buttons when seated.</li>
            <li>Button all buttons that are designed to be fastened, typically two or three on the side. Double-breasted jackets remain buttoned when seated.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Coordinate Colors and Patterns:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>For a timeless look, go for neutral colors like navy, charcoal, or black for formal settings. Lighter colors or patterned fabrics (e.g., pinstripes or plaids) are great for business-casual or social occasions.</li>
            <li>Ensure your shirt contrasts with the suit (a white or light blue shirt is versatile). The tie should coordinate with both the suit and shirt; choose complementary colors or patterns that don’t overwhelm the look.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Accesorize Appropriately:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Tie:</strong> The width of the tie should match the width of your jacket lapels. Choose a tie length that reaches just above your belt buckle.</li>
            <li><strong>Pocket Square:</strong> Adds sophistication; it should complement but not exactly match your tie.</li>
            <li><strong>Tie Clip:</strong> Place it between the third and fourth buttons of your shirt, ensuring it’s no wider than the tie.</li>
            <li><strong>Belt and Shoes:</strong> Always match your belt and shoe colors for cohesion. Black, brown, or oxblood are standard choices.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Additional Tips:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Check the Lapel Style:</strong> Notched lapels are the most versatile, while peak lapels are more formal, and shawl lapels are often seen on tuxedos or dinner jackets.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer a Vest:</strong> For a three-piece suit, the vest should fit snugly and cover the waistband. Leave the bottom button of the vest unbuttoned for a traditional touch.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

      </ul>
