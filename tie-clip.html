    <p class="tie-clip-describe">A tie clip is a small accessory used to keep a necktie in place by fastening it to the shirt underneath. Itâ€™s a practical piece that prevents the tie from moving around, especially in windy or active situations, but it also adds a touch of elegance to the overall look.</p>

      <h3>How to wear a Tie Clip</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Position The Tie Clip Correctly:</strong> Place the tie clip between the third and fourth buttons on your dress shirt. This is around the middle to upper-middle part of your chest, ensuring the tie is secure and that the clip is visible without being too high or low.</li>

        <li><strong>Align It Horizontally:</strong>The clip should sit flat and straight across your tie and shirt. Avoid angling it, as a straight line adds a cleaner, more professional look.</li>

        <li><strong>Fasten Both Tie and Shirt:</strong>Slide the tie clip over both the tie and the placket (the strip of fabric with buttons) of your dress shirt. This ensures your tie stays in place rather than just holding the two ends of the tie together.</li>

        <li><strong>Choose the Right Width:</strong>The clip should ideally be around 3/4 the width of your tie but no wider than the tie itself. This keeps the clip in proportion with your tie for a well-balanced look.</li>

        <li><strong>Pair It with the Right Tie:</strong>A tie clip works best with a standard-width or slim tie. Avoid very narrow ties, which can make the clip look too large.</li>

      </ul>
