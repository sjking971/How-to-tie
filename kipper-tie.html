      <h3>How to Tie a Kipper Tie</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>Begin by placing the kipper tie around your neck, ensuring that the wider end (the blade) is on your right side and the narrower end (the tail) is on your left. The wider end should hang lower than the narrower end.</li>

      <li>Cross the wider end over the narrower end, forming an X shape just below your chin.Bring the wide end across the front of the narrow end, crossing it to the left.</li>

      <li>Take the wide end (now on top) and bring it underneath the narrow end, pulling it up through the neck loop you created.</li>

      <li>Bring the wide end down, then wrap it over the front of the narrow end again, creating a second X shape.</li>

      <li>Tuck the wide end down through the loop that has formed at the front of the knot. This creates a neat finish to the knot.</li>

      <li>Pull gently on both ends of the tie to tighten the knot. Ensure that the kipper tie sits comfortably around your neck without being too tight.</li>

      <li>Adjust the tie to make sure it hangs evenly. The bottom of the kipper tie should ideally reach the middle of your belt buckle or slightly above, depending on your personal preference.</li>

      <li>Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the tie is centered and looks neat. The kipper tieâ€™s distinctive wide blade should be visible and properly positioned.</li>
      </ul>
