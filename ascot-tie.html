    <p class="ascot-tie-describe">The ascot can be styled in various ways, from a traditional knot to a more relaxed drape. It can be tucked into a waistcoat or worn over a shirt, allowing the wearer to express their personal style while maintaining an air of elegance. In essence, the ascot tie is not merely an accessory; it is a celebration of sophistication, individuality, and a nod to a bygone era of sartorial excellence. Those who don the ascot do so with an inherent sense of confidence and style, embodying the essence of refined taste and timeless elegance.</p>

      <h3>How to Tie an Ascot Tie</h3>
      Instructions:
      <ul>
        <li>Begin by placing the ascot around your neck, ensuring that the wider end (the "tail") is longer than the narrower end (the "blade"). The wide end should hang down on your right side.</li>

      <li>Cross the wider end over the narrower end, forming an X shape just below your chin.</li>

      <li>Take the wide end and bring it underneath the narrow end, pulling it up through the neck loop you created.</li>

      <li>Instead of pulling the wide end all the way through, let it hang down in front of the narrow end. This will form a loop.</li>

      <li>Take the narrow end (the one on the left) and tuck it into the loop you just created with the wide end. This creates the ascot's distinctive look.</li>

      <li>Pull gently on both ends to tighten the knot. Ensure the ascot sits comfortably around your neck without being too tight.</li>

      <li>You can leave the ends of the ascot hanging freely or tuck them into your waistcoat for a more polished appearance. Adjust the front of the ascot for the desired drape and shape.</li>

      <li>Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the ascot is symmetrical and looks neat. It should complement your outfit and sit comfortably against your collar.</li>
      </ul>
